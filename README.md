# Bioinformatics-projects
This repository contains my small projects in bioinformatics, either as collaborations with experimentalists or as hobby projects Iâ€™ve explored in my free time.

- seq.py: This Python code demonstrates how to perform a pairwise sequence alignment between the exemplary SOD1 gene sequences of humans and dogs. The sequences are aligned such that matching positions are represented with \texttt{|}.
